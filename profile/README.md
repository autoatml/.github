## autoatml

This is a code repository jointly from the [Deringer (Oxford)](http://deringer.chem.ox.ac.uk) and [George (BAM)](https://jageo.github.io/) groups for **auto**mating **at**omistic **m**achine **l**earning (**autoatml**). 

For the moment, this organization hosts the [autoplex code](https://github.com/jageo/autoplex) and we expect to expand it further in the future.
